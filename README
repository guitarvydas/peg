A couple of experiments using the PEG parser "esrap".

Goals:

1. See that PEG grammars can be used to create read macros.

2. Can we program in a different syntax inside #{ ... } and have it converted to CL syntax?  E.G., can we write prolog code in prolog syntax and have it compile to CL?


How to load it manually (in the interim):

>  (ql:quickload "esrap")
>  (ql:quickload "cl-heredoc")
>  (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\> #'cl-heredoc:read-heredoc)
>  (ql:register-local-projects)
>  (compile-file "peg.lisp")
>  (load "peg")

Examples:

arith.lisp: esrap grammar for a simple 4-banger calculator-interpreter (waiting to be converted to a peg grammar)

arith-mac.lisp: esrap grammar for a simple 4-banger calculator which returns the equivalent CL code.  If unquoted, CL will compile and execute the expression.  (waiting to be converted to a peg grammar)

pegself.lisp: peg written in itself ; was used to generate peg.lisp.

peg-bootstrap.lisp: peg written manually, for bootstrapping.



-- How to load and build from scratch, using manually constructed peg parser --


How to load:

Currently, in this early stage, use the listener:

(progn 
  (ql:quickload "esrap")
  (ql:quickload "cl-heredoc")
  (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\> #'cl-heredoc:read-heredoc)
  (ql:register-local-projects)
  (compile-file "peg-bootstrap.lisp")
  (load "peg-bootstrap")
  (compile-file "pegself.lisp")
  (load "pegself"))

regression test (manual at the moment):

> (in-package :peg-grammar-bootstrap)
> (pegself)
cut the result into regress.lisp and get rid of the surrounding progn
> (in-package :peg-grammar)
compile and load regress.lisp
compile and load pegself-regress.lisp
> (rpegself)
cut the result into regress2.lisp and get rid of the surrounding progn
and compare the results with the contents of regress.lisp

if OK, copy regress.lisp into peg.lisp
